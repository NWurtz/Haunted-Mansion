	<div id="startGame">
	Hello <span id="Name"></span>! You have had a long day at work but it is time to go home.
	You are driving along on a Saturday night when you realize you are low on gas.<br>
	The car keeps driving for two more miles before you run out and have to pull to the side.
	In the distance you see a old creepy abandoned mansion.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Continue();'> Click to continue</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Continue">
	There are no signs indicating gas stations nearby and there is no service for your phone anywhere.
	There is no hope for your car anymore.<br> Do you want to walk towards the mansion or walk along the road?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Foyer()'>Check out Mansion</button>    <button onclick=' Road()'>Look for help down the road</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Road">
	You start to proceed down the road.
	The wind and rain start to pick up the farther away from the mansion you go.
	The street lights flicker giving off a dim<br> light every couple of seconds or so.
	After about 5 minutes of walking down the road the street lights stop flickering and go out.
	You feel a strong force hit<br> the back of your head.
	You are knocked unconscious.
	You wake up in the foyer of the mansion.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Foyer()'>Click to Continue</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Foyer">
	You enter what seems to be the foyer. There seems to be two paths in front of you.
	One goes to the kitchen and the other goes to the study. Choose wisely!
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Kitchen()'>Go to Kitchen</button>    <button onclick=' Study()'>Go to Study</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Kitchen">
	As you enter the kitchen you see many cabinets and a door to your right.
	You see a stove, fridge, and dishwasher. Other than that the room is fairly bare.
	<br>Do you want to check the door, search the kitchen, or head back to the foyer? 
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Door1()'>Check Door</button>    <button onclick=' Kitchen2()'>Search the Kitchen</button> <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Door1">
	The door is locked and there is no key in sight.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Kitchen2()'>Search Kitchen</button>    <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Kitchen2">
	You open one cabinet in the kitchen and find enough ingredients to make your favorite kind of sandwich.
	You also notice a loose floor board in the corner. 
	<br>What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Food()'>Make a Sandwich</button>    <button onclick=' Floor()'>Lift loose floor board</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Food">
	You use the ingredients that you found to make your favorite sandwich.
	Do you want to eat it?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick='Eat(); Endphrase()'>Eat the Sandwich</button>    <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Eat">
	You take a bite of what seems to be a glorious sandwich. You cant remember having a better sandwich than this one...
	<br> You start feeling funny. Your mouth starts tingling. Soon your entire body is shaking frantically.
	<br>You drop the sandwich and start walking backward. how you a sandwich be doing this... how ...how...
	<br> Poison!
	<br> You are dead. Don't Trust food!
	<br>
	<br><br>  <button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Floor">
	You approach the floor and notice that the panel is loose. Curious, you take the board out of the floor
	After the first one is taken out several other boards become loose. 
	<br>After 5 minutes of taking out floor boards
	part of a stairway is revealed. 
	<br>Do you want to go down the stairs?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Basement()'>Go Down the stairs</button>    <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Basement">
	You follow the stairs down to what appears to be a basement. The moment you get to the basement the passage you
	you came through closes. You are trapped in the basement. <br>Besides from the dust and cobwebs all around
	the stench of rotten eggs fills the air. You notice a jail cell off the left and doors on opposite sides
	of the basement. <br>You can see a bright light coming from one of the doors. <br>Where do you want to go?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Shining()'>Open the Shining Door</button>    <button onclick=' Jail()'>Look in the jail cell</button> <button onclick=' Boiler()'>Open other Door</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Boiler">
	You enter the room and instantly notice how much warmer this room is. That's probably due to the giant boiler machine
	in the corner. There is also a desk with several rusty screws and nails. <br> On the wall you see a key rack which happens
	to have a key on it.<br> What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Key()'>Take the Key</button>    <button onclick=' Basement()'>Go back to the Basement</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Key">
	You took the key off the rack. You seem to think it will come in handy.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Basement()'>Go back to the Basement</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Jail">
	The jail cell looks like it hasn't been used in years. The bars wont budge and there appears to be no 
	lock on the cell. You open the cell to see something in the shadows of the cell. <br> As you approach
	you make out a the figure of a person. On a closer inspection it appears to be a skeleton.
	<br>The skeleton is wearing the same outfit you are wearing... Spooky. <br> It looks like person was a <span id="Job"></span>
	just like you...
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Basement()'>Go back to the Basement</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Shining">
	You open the door and see piles on piles of gold. The piles vary in height up to what you guess to be
	10 feet high. The piles of gold are lining the outside of the room.<br> You have never seen this much gold 
	in your entire life. Between stacks of gold you see a door on the other side of the room. 
	<br>What do  you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Takegold()'>Take the Gold</button>    <button onclick=' Door2()'>Go through the Door in the back</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Takegold">
	There is no way someone would be able to keep track of all of this gold so what's wrong with taking a little
	bit of gold.<br> You start to take some of the gold and stuff your pockets. Suddenly the room starts shaking. 
	What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Run(); Endphrase2()'>Run for Door</button> <button onclick=' Gold(); Endphrase()'>Take MORE Gold</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Run">
	As you run towards the door, metal bars come down from the ceiling preventing entry through the door. 
	You spot another door as you look around the room. <br>This door was unlocked and you seem to be outside.
	Safe... sound... and sticky? <br>
	You reach your hand into your pocket and take out what you thought was gold, but was actually
	Chocolate coins in gold wrapping...<br> Chocolate... Chocolate. Hey it is better than nothing.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Gold">
	Filled with greed you continue stuffing your pockets with gold. The shaking increases as some of the
	gold piles start falling over.<br> You don't seem to notice you are focued on holding and getting as much 
	gold as you can fit in your pockets. <br>You get all the gold you could ever want as one of the gold piles
	falls over knocking you unconscious <br>as you get crushed by the gold you loved so much. 
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Door2">
	You ignore the gold and walk through the door into a smaller room. The entire room wall to wall is
	covered in mirrors. In the center of the room you see a skeleton sitting in throne.<br> There is 
	a shiny gold crown on its head. Behind the throne  there is another door.<br> What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Crown(); Endphrase()'>Take Crown off Skeleton</button>    <button onclick=' Locked()'>Try to open Door</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Crown">
	You start walking towards the throne, and you feel yourself entering a trance but you can't escape it. 
	The entire room reflects you walking to the throne.<br> Once at the throne you take the crown off the skeleton's head. You feel as if you are holding the 
	entire world in your hands. <br>This power runs through your veins as you put the crown on.<br> Suddenly you 
	hear, "At last my legacy continues..." as you become possessed by the spirit of the house.<br> Never again
	will you leave! Muahahahahaha
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Locked">
	The door is locked and you realize there is no other way out. I guess you better check out the throne.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Crown(); Endphrase()'>Take Crown off Skeleton</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Treasure">
	That key you found earlier actually came in handy. You open the door to what seems to be a back entrance
	to the house. Outside you find a car.<br> The car is filled with gold, and the key seems to be in the ignition.
	Your car is out of gas and this one is filled with gold. <br>After the crazy night you have had this feel well deserved.
	<br>Congrats you made it out of the mansion with a prize.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Study">
	You head down the path that leads to the study.	You see a couple of paintings and desk on opposite sides of the room. 
	<br>There is also a bookcase in the corner of the room.
    <br>What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Painting()'>Look at the Paintings</button>    <button onclick=' Desk()'>Check the Desk</button> <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Desk">
	On the desk you find a small bottle filled with a mysterious liquid.
	The liquid seems to be realising a vapor that is rising from the lid of the bottle into the room.
	<br>Do you want to smell the bottle?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Bottle(); Endphrase()'>Smell Bottle</button>    <button onclick=' Painting()'>Look at the the Paintings</button> <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Bottle">
	You pick up the bottle and bring it to your nose. The vapor rising and you take a wiff.
	You start to get dizzy and realize that is room is twisting and spinning.<br>
	You turn around and look for somewhere to sit but the second you try to take a step your legs
	give and you fall to the ground. Your eyes get blurry and<br> you pass out into an eternal sleep.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Painting">
	You walk over to the wall of paintings. Each painting seems to be a portrait of a different person.
	You stand in the middle of the room looking at the paintings and realize they are all looking at you.<br>
	It does not matter where you go. All of the paintings seem to be looking at you. Despite being
	creeped out you notice that one of the paintings is crooked.<br> You go to adjust it to find that
	behind the painting there is a button.<br> What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Button()'>Press Button</button>     <button onclick=' Desk()'>Check the Desk</button>    <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Button">
	You push the button and the room starts shaking. The bookcase in the corner opens up to reveal
	a passage into another part of the house.<br> What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Bookcase()'>Go down passage behind bookcase</button>    <button onclick=' Desk()'>Check the Desk</button>    <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Bookcase">
	You walk through the passage and suddenly the passage becomes lit with torches. The moment you walk
	through the bookcase it closes behind you.<br> I guess there is only one way to go.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Riddle()'>Continue down Hallway</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Riddle">
	At the end of the hall you come across two doors separated by a wall. The doors are both locked.
	On wall you see a chalkboard.<br> Above it is a riddle scratched into the wall. The riddle is:
	<br><br>
	There is a certain crime, that if it is attempted, is punishable,
	<br>but if it is committed, it is not punishable.
	<br> What is the crime?
	<br><br>
	<input id='riddleInput' type='text' size ='5'>  <button onclick=' Riddle2(riddleInput)'> Enter</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Right">
	The door on the left unlocks, and you go through it. You appear outside. It appears you got the riddle 
	right and are allowed out of the house. You made it out alive.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Wrong">
	The door on the right unlocks, and you go through it. As you step through the door it closes behind you.
	You appear to be in an underground arena. <br>There is a crowd of people all around the arena chanting 
	"Kill that <span id="Gender"></span> Scum!"<br>
	A gate on the other side of the arena slowly opens up and a giant lion appears.<br> What do you want to do? 
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Run2()'>Run away</button>    <button onclick=' Fight(); Endphrase()'>Fight the Lion</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Run2">
	You start running around the arena to avoid the lion. Surprisingly you are faster than the lion but you do not 
	know if you can keep it up.<br> You do notice that there is a little space in the wall you can try hide in, but 
	it may be easier to climb out of the arena when the lion is distracted. <br>What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Climb(); Endphrase()'>Attempt to climb out</button>    <button onclick=' Hide()'>Hide in a small space in the wall</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Fight">
	Filled with adrenaline you charge at the lion thinking you can kill it and survive. You punch the lion but it seems
    unaffected by your attack.<br> The lion just roars and eats you in one bite. You are dead!	
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Climb">
	After dodging the lion you make your way to the nearest wall. You jump and try to climb the wall but the lion just
	jumps up and tears you down.<br> You became a snack for the lion. You are dead!
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Hide">
	You run into the little space in the wall and hope that the lion doesnt see you. The lion spots where you are 
	in the wall and charges at it. You pray for your life just as the lion rams into the wall.<br> The wall crumbles down
	and you can see the outside world. The lion seems to be stunned at the moment. <br>What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Escape(); Endphrase2()'>See a chance and run out</button>    <button onclick=' Stay(); Endphrase()'>See if the Lion is dead</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Escape">
	You realize this is your chance and you run for it. You make it out safely but you have no idea where you are. 
	It is better than being stuck in that house.<br> You made it out of the house alive.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Stay">
	You go over to the lion and check to see if it is dead. On your way to check you accidently step on the lions tail
	waking him up in a furious rage. <br>He lunges at you and you die. You are dead.
