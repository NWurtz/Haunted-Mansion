	<div id="startGame">
	You are driving along on a Saturday night when you realize you are low on gas.
	The car keeps driving for two more miles before you run out and have to<br> pull to the side.
	In the distance you see a old creepy abandoned mansion.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Continue();'> Click to continue</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Continue">
	There are no signs indicating gas stations nearby and there is no service for your phone anywhere.
	There is no hope for your car anymore. Do you want to<br> walk towards the mansion or walk along the road?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Foyer()'>Check out Mansion</button>    <button onclick=' Road()'>Look for help down the road</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Road">
	You start to proceed down the road.
	The wind and rain start to pick up the farther away from the mansion you go.
	The street lights flicker giving off a dim<br> light every couple of seconds or so.
	After about 5 minutes of walking down the road the street lights stop flickering and go out.
	You feel a strong force hit<br> the back of your head.
	You are knocked unconscious.
	You wake up in the foyer of the mansion.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Foyer()'>Click to Continue</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Foyer">
	You enter what seems to be the foyer. There seems to be two paths in front of you.
	One goes to the kitchen and the other goes to the study. Choose wisely!
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Kitchen()'>Go to Kitchen</button>    <button onclick=' Study()'>Go to Study</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Kitchen">
	As you enter the kitchen you see many cabinets and a door to your right.
	You see a stove, fridge, and dishwasher. Other than that the room is fairly bare.
	Do you want to check the door,<br> search the kitchen, or head back to the foyer? 
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Door1()'>Check Door</button>    <button onclick=' Kitchen2()'>Search the Kitchen</button> <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Door1">
	The door is locked and there is no key in sight.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Kitchen2()'>Search Kitchen</button>    <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Kitchen2">
	You open one cabinet in the kitchen and find enough ingredients to make your favorite kind of sandwich.
	You also notice a loose floor board in the corner. What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Food()'>Make a Sandwich</button>    <button onclick=' Floor()'>Lift loose floor board</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Food">
	You use the ingredients that you found to make your favorite sandwich.
	Do you want to eat it?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick='Eat(); Endphrase()'>Eat the Sandwich</button>    <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Eat">
	You take a bite of what seems to be a glorious sandwich. You cant remember having a better sandwich than this one...
	<br> you start feeling funny. Your mouth starts tingling. Soon your entire body is shaking frantically.
	You drop the sandwich and start walking backward. how you a sandwich be doing this... how ...how...
	<br> Poison!
	<br> You are dead. Don't Trust food!
	<br>
	<br><br>  <button onclick=' startGame()'>Play Again?</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Floor">
	You approach the floor and notice that the panel is loose. Curious, you take the board out of the floor
	After the first one is taken out several other boards become loose. After 5 minutes of taking out floor boards
	part of a stair way is revealed. Do you want to go down the stairs?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Basement()'>Go Down the stairs</button>    <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Basement">
	You follow the stairs down to what appears to be a basement. The moment you get to the basement the passage you
	you came through closes. You are trapped in the basement. Besides from the dust and cobwebs all around
	the stench of rotten eggs fills the air. You notice a jail cell off the left and doors on opposite sides
	of the basement. You can see a bright light coming from one of the doors. Where do you want to go?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Shining()'>Open the Shining Door</button>    <button onclick=' Jail()'>Look in the jail cell</button> <button onclick=' Boiler()'>Open other Door</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Boiler">
	You enter the room and instantly notice how much warmer this room is. That's probably due to the giant boiler machine
	in the corner. There is also a desk with several rusty screws and nails. On the wall you see a key rack which happens
	to have a key on it. What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Key()'>Take the Key</button>    <button onclick=' Basement()'>Go back to the Basement</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Key">
	You took the key off the rack. You seem to think it will come in handy.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Basement()'>Go back to the Basement</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Jail">
	The jail cell looks like it hasn't been used in years. The bars wont budge and there appears to be no 
	lock on the cell. You open the cell to see something in the shadows of the cell. As you approach
	you make out a the figure of a person. On a closer inspection it appears to be a skeleton.
	The skeleton is wearing the same outfit you are wearing... Spooky

	<div id="Study">
	You head down the path that leads to the study.
	You see a couple of paintings and desk on opposite sides of the room. What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Painting()'>Look at the Paintings</button>    <button onclick=' Desk()'>Check the Desk</button> <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Desk">
	On the desk you find a small bottle filled with a mysterious liquid.
	The liquid seems to be realising a vapor that is rising from the lid of the bottle into the<br> room.
	Do you want to smell the bottle?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Bottle(); Endphrase()'>Smell Bottle</button>    <button onclick=' Painting()'>Look at the the Paintings</button> <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Bottle">
	You pick up the bottle and bring it to your nose. The vapor rising and you take a wiff.
	You start to get dizzy and realize that is room is twisting and spinning.<br>
	You turn around and look for somewhere to sit but the second you try to take a step your legs
	give and you fall to the ground. Your eyes get blurry and<br> you pass out into an eternal sleep.
