	You are driving along on a Saturday night when you realize you are low on gas.
	The car keeps driving for two more miles before you run out and have to<br> pull to the side.
	In the distance you see a old creepy abandoned mansion.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Continue();'> Click to continue</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Continue">
	There are no signs indicating gas stations nearby and there is no service for your phone anywhere.
	There is no hope for your car anymore. Do you want to<br> walk towards the mansion or walk along the road?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Foyer()'>Check out Mansion</button>    <button onclick=' Road()'>Look for help down the road</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Road">
	You start to proceed down the road.
	The wind and rain start to pick up the farther away from the mansion you go.
	The street lights flicker giving off a dim<br> light every couple of seconds or so.
	After about 5 minutes of walking down the road the street lights stop flickering and go out.
	You feel a strong force hit<br> the back of your head.
	You are knocked unconscious.
	You wake up in the foyer of the mansion.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Foyer()'>Click to Continue</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Foyer">
	You enter what seems to be the foyer. There seems to be two paths in front of you.
	One goes to the kitchen and the other goes to the study. Choose wisely!
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Kitchen()'>Go to Kitchen</button>    <button onclick=' Study()'>Go to Study</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Kitchen">
	As you enter the kitchen you see many cabinents and a door to your right.
	You see a stove, fridge, and dishwasher.
	Do you want to check the door,<br> search the kitchen, or head back to the foyer? 
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Door1()'>Check Door</button>    <button onclick=' Kitchen2()'>Search the Kitchen</button> <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Door1">
	The door is locked and there is no key in sight.
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Kitchen2()'>Search Kitchen</button>    <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Kitchen2">
	You open one cabinet and the kitchen and find enough ingredients to make your favorite kind of sandwhich.
	You also see a loose floor board. What do you want to do?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Food()'>Make a Sandwich</button>    <button onclick=' Floor()'>Lift loose floor board</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Food">
	You use the ingredients that you found to make your favorite sandwhich.
	Do you want to eat it?
	<br><br>
	<button onclick=' Eat()'>Eat the Sandwhich</button>    <button onclick=' Foyer()'>Go back to the Foyer</button>
	</div>
	<div id="Eat">
	You take a bite of what seems to be a glorious sandwhich. You cant remember having a better sandwhich than this one...
	<br> you start feeling funny. Your mouth starts tingling. Soon your entire body is shaking frantically.
	You drop the sandwhich and start walking backward. how you a sandwhich be doing this... how ...how...
	<br> Poison!
	<br> You are dead. Don't Trust food!

	You turn around and look for somewhere to sit but the second you try to take a step your legs
	give and you fall to the ground. Your eyes get blurry and<br> you pass out into an eternal sleep.
