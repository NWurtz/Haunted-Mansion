I talked to the Professor and he said it would be a good idea to switch all of the java script code
That we are sending to the Outputdiv to different divs in the HTML and each function hides and reveals a different div
with the buttons. 

Look at the Multiple Pages in one file program under resources. 
If I get time before the class to do an example of one I will. 


We also need to add in the object for the player and an array of sorts and what not. You can pick and choose what you
think will be most helpful to the project today.

If you have any questions shoot me a text and i'll see what I can do. 

Thank you and I will periodically work on the program this week. 

Happy Thanksgiving
